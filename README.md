# SuperBoxPlotD3v3
SuperBoxPlotD3v3 is derived from the box plot of Jens Grubert with a dot plot superimposed over the top.
The additions I did are released under the MIT License: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

It also reads form a json file instead of a csv file. It has tooltips for the boxes.

It is still a work in progress.

Author: Steven Michael Morrison, Ph.D.
Derived from Jens Grubert's box plot, who derived it from Mick Bostock's BoxPlot.
The tooltips are from http://bl.ocks.org/Caged/6476579.
